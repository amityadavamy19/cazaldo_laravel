	What is E-commerce?</h4>
<p>
	All the commercial activities such as the exchange of goods and money over the internet are termed as E-commerce. Some big reputed companies operating in India are Flipkart, Amazon, Shop clue, etc.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	What do E-commerce Companies do?</h4>
<p>
	These companies neither manufacture the products nor trade them. They provide platforms where buyers and sellers come together to fulfill each other&rsquo;s requirements. For this robust platform, e-commerce companies collect the commission on every order from the seller.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	How does E-commerce platform work for the Market?</h4>
<p>
	E-commerce companies have two portals i) buyer portal and ii) seller portal.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Buyer portal:</strong>&nbsp;on this portal buyer views the product, add the product in the cart, place the order, and make the payment.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Seller Portal:</strong>&nbsp;on this portal sellers receive orders and execute them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Every seller registers an e-shop on the seller portal by filling up the registration forms and submitting necessary documents like Aadhar, Pan Card, etc. Upon successful registration, sellers list their products in their e-shop. The listing goes live in the buyers portal, where a buyer can place the order after approval of the listing from the e-commerce company.</p>
<p>
	Once the order is assigned to a Seller, it&rsquo;s seller responsibility to execute the order by managing the product (manufacturing/ stock maintenance/new purchase/ etc), pack it, and handover to e-commerce logistics in the stipulated time frame (normally 2 days). Sellers are given the option to ship the material by the means of their logistics (i.e leading courier services) or the seller can opt for the services from E-commerce logistic partner.</p>
<p>
	Every e-commerce company follows a minimum 15-day replacement/ return policy for buyer&rsquo;s satisfaction. The same needs to be managed by Seller in co-ordination with logistic partners if the case comes. (If the seller decides to cancel the order or delays the shipment they get penalized heavily and same is payable by the seller)</p>
<p>
	Once the buyer receives the product and the payment is done at the time of ordering or COD, E-commerce Company pays to the seller in their bank account as per their payment schedule.</p>
<p>
	There is a possibility that the buyer may not available at the delivery location at the time of delivery, the product could not be delivered or the buyer cancels the order or e-commerce company finds that buyer information is wrong, in such a situation, the order is cancelled. All these cases are termed as cancellation.</p>
<p>
	Cancellation if done after the product is shipped, it is termed as a return. As per logistic partner return policy, the returned product is handed over to the seller (leading e-commerce company follow 30-day return product policy). The seller has to manage all the returns by themselves in close co-ordination with the e-commerce logistics company.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">

<p>

<p>

	<li>

	<li>
		We execute the order from our pickup location. In the process of maintaining the health of your account and as a part of business strategy, we keep updating the pickup location and we keep you informed from time to time before any such changes.</li>
	<li>
		We manage the product return/ replacement at our end.</li>
	<li>
		For any reason, if we fail to ship the material to logistic partner on time after your timely payment. All the penalties made by e-commerce companies shall be borne by us.</li>
	<li>
		For every calendar month, all the returns report is generated on the 15th of the previous calendar month, and on 16th, all the return products purchase cost will be credited in your e-wallet, created in the Zoho invoice software. (We provide the web access of Zoho and its login credentials for the maintenance of your records).</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	What is settlement value/final value?</h4>
<p>
	E-commerce sites charge some commission, shipment charges, and taxes. The consolidated charge range from 25 percent to 45 percent of product listing cost. The actual charge is calculated based on the product and its category. For more details please refer e-commerce sites seller support site.</p>
<p>
	For example, a product ABC is having MRP: INR 130/-, we list it at INR 125/-. The E-commerce company will retain their charges INR 25/- and pay seller INR 100/- including TDS. This INR 100/- is the settlement value/ final value. We make the invoice considering this settlement value.</p>

<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	When will I get the payment from the market..?</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Step by step process.</strong></p>
<ul class="faq-list">
	<li>
		Suppose you get the order for 10 books on 1st July.</li>
	<li>
		On 2nd July we will raise the invoice and we seek your payment before 11:00 AM on 2nd July.</li>
	<li>
		On 3rd July the product is handed over to a logistic partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Considering 7 days of transit.</p>
<p>
	Based on transit time, we understand, on 10th July orders will be delivered to the buyer and there may be one of the following three possibilities:-</p>
<p>
	<strong>Possibility 1, Successful delivery:-</strong></p>
<p>
	Out of 10, just 6 books got delivered. Therefore you will be eligible to get paid for those 6 books from the e-commerce site after 15 days based on the e-commerce payment schedule. Therefore payout will qualify on 25th July.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Possibility 2, Replacement:-</strong></p>
<p>
	Out of 4, just 1 book came for a replacement, therefore add 14 more days for replacement cycle payout (i.e. buyer to seller and then seller to buyer). Therefore payout will qualify on August 9th, for this one book.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Possibility 3, Return:-</strong></p>
<p>
	Balance 3 books got returned. As stated earlier on the 16th of the following calendar month of order month, we will credit back the product value in the Zoho invoice e-wallet. i.e. in the above case on 16th August, the credit amount will be reflected in your e-wallet (The said solution is provided to sellers who opt for Dropshipping only).</p>
<p>
	Considering the e-commerce company finds out the order placed by the buyer is placed wrongly hence it will result in cancellation. If the product is handed over to a logistic partner than Possibility 3 management would be applicable. If the product is not handed over to the logistic partner than the paid amount will be adjusted in the next order.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	Which e-commerce payout cycle is best..?</h4>
<p>
	We recommend two reliable e-commerce platforms Flipkart and Amazon. Flipkart&#39;spayout cycle is every Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Amazon pays on a single day of the week based on the computer algorithm and seller&rsquo;s registration day. Refer to these companies&#39; portal for more details.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	Can a seller do e-commerce work alone..?</h4>
<p>
	Yes. But we recommend you join us to meet the price competitiveness and remain in this industry for a long time.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	Can a seller include their product in our product line..?</h4>
<p>
	Our vendor management team is working day and night to get competitive rates, best quality, and authentic products. However please do provide your product details to our representative during the registration process. If our team finds merits for inclusion in our product range we will confirm to you. Normally, we do the business by listing our approved products only.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	What should be the minimum budget for this business..?</h4>
<p>
	Please note this is a business model of your e-shop. We may want to understand your budget. However, we recommend maintaining the order execution flow for at least 45 days, a basis in which the minimum budget should be planned for your business.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	We want to invest some money what profit/ guarantee/ security can I get from your model?</h4>
<p>
	We are dealing with a traditional supply chain management (SCM) online business and a one-stop e-commerce solution provider. This is not any kind of investment scheme. We work for the committed margin percentage and continue to work until we achieve all your business goals.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	What will happen if we stop business operations?</h4>
<p>
	We want to remind you that during the pandemic, COVID-19, e-commerce is the only industry that was fulfilling the buyer and seller needs. Multiple companies are investing in this industry and trying hard to give tough competition to Amazon and Flipkart. They can stay alive only if they have sellers. Please note that the e-commerce industry has a very good future ahead and we are a fast growing company in this sector.<br />
	Do you still think we may stop our operation in this emerging market conditions?</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
	What is a traditional SCM business..?</h4>
<p>
	Tradition Supply Chain Management (SCM) system includes following genealogy:-<br />
	Manufacturer -&gt; Distributor -&gt; Whole seller -&gt; Retailer.</p>
<h4 class="about-heading why-gt-sub-heading">
